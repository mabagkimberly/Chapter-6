# Chapter-6
*I learned how to use basic widgets in Flutter, such as Scaffold, AppBar, SafeArea, Container, Text, RichText, Column, and Row, which form the foundation of most app UIs. These widgets allow me to structure the layout, display text, handle safe areas (like avoiding notches), and create containers for visual styling. I also explored various types of buttons, which are essential for user interaction.

The chapter taught me how to nest Column and Row widgets together to create complex UI layouts. By combining these widgets, I can design flexible and responsive interfaces that adapt to different screen sizes. Additionally, I learned how to include images, icons, and decorators to enhance the app's visuals and user experience.

I also learned how to use text field widgets to retrieve, validate, and manipulate user input, making the app interactive and dynamic. Finally, the chapter showed me how to check the appâ€™s orientation, enabling me to adjust the layout based on whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode. This chapter gave me a strong understanding of how to design user-friendly and visually appealing Flutter apps.
